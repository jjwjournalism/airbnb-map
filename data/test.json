    "description": "<b>The space</b><br />This is a very small, but very unique, free-standing gate house. Located in Manhattan on 3rd St between Ave B and C in the East Village. Since it's free-standing, you have no neighbors and direct access to the street. It's just you in this studio-sized, ivy-covered, brick house. <br /><br />The interior space is one very small room, furnished with a loft bed, kitchenette and separate, full bathroom. The ceilings are very high - 12 feet - and there are three skylights so it feels open and gets a lot of light. There's also a side door that leads to a gated, private yard space - very rare amenity in Manhattan!<br /><br />There are two places to sleep - a full-sized bed in the loft or the full-sized pullout sofa.  To give you a sense of how small the space is, when the sofa bed is pulled out, there's just barely enough room to walk around it. So the space is best suited for one or two people but can officially sleep a third if they are very small and don't mind the cr",
